   * If \p timeout is 0, rx_frames will not wait for frames if none are
   * available, and f will not be invoked.  If \p timeout is -1 (the
   * default), rx_frames will block indefinitely until frames are
   * available.  If \p timeout is positive, it indicates the number of
   * milliseconds to wait for a frame to become available.  Once the
   * timeout has expired, rx_frames will return, f never having been
   * invoked.
   *
   * \p f will be called on each frame that is available.
   * \p f returns a bool.  If false, return from rx_frames now even
   * though more frames may be available; if true, continue if
   * more frames are ready.
   *
   * \returns EB_OK if at least one frame was received
   * \returns EB_WOULD_BLOCK if \p timeout is 0 and the call would have blocked
   * \returns EB_TIMED_OUT if timeout occurred
   * \returns EB_ERROR if there was an unrecoverable error.
